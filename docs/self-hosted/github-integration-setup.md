# GitHub (Enterprise) Integration Setup
## Private Packagist Self-Hosted

This guide explains how to setup an OAuth integration for Private Packagist Self-Hosted with either the on-premises version of GitHub, or their public service on github.com.

To setup a GitHub integration with Private Packagist start by selecting "GitHub" as the platform and enter the URL of your GitHub Enterprise Server or <i>https://github.com</i> to use the public GitHub server as seen in the example below. A link to setup the OAuth application on GitHub will automatically be displayed.

## Creating an OAuth Application
Do not submit the integration form yet, but copy the content from the "Callback URL / Redirect URL" and follow the setup link to your GitHub server. The fields Client ID and Client Secret remain empty for now.

Register a new application on GitHub. This will reveal the client ID and client secret required for finishing the setup on Private Packagist.
