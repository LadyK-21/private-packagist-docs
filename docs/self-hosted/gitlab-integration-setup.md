# GitLab Integration Setup
## Private Packagist Self-Hosted

## Initial Setup
Hit the “Add integration“ button on the admin page to get to the form below. To setup a GitLab integration with Private Packagist start by selecting "GitLab" as the platform and enter the URL of your own GitLab server or use <i>https://gitlab.com</i> for the public GitLab server as seen in the example below. A link to setup the oauth application on GitLab will automatically be displayed.

## Add an OAuth Application
Do not submit the integration form yet, but copy the content from the "Callback URL / Redirect URL" and follow the setup link to your GitLab server.

Make sure the "api" and "read_user" scopes are both checked and save the new application. This will reveal the credentials required to finish the setup on Private Packagist.

If you have full admin access on GitLab, then you can also create an application in the GitLab admin section under Applications.
There are two additional checkmarks on that page: "trusted" should remain unchecked, and "confidential" should remain checked.

## Finish the Setup
Copy and paste the "Application Id" and "Secret" value back into the Private Packagist integration form and submit the form with the "Create Integration" button.
