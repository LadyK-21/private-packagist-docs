## Installing Replicated
Replicated is the application which will provide you with a management interface to your Private Packagist Self-Hosted installation and allow you to monitor the task and perform maintenance operations such as backups or updates.

The easiest way to install replicated is the easy install script. You can run it using the following two commands:
```
curl -sSL -o install.sh https://get.replicated.com/docker/privatepackagist/stable
sudo bash ./install.sh
```

Alternatively you can manually install the required tools and services and you can install Replicated onto a machine that is not connected to the internet. Replicated on Kubernetes or Docker Swarm is not currently supported for use with Private Packagist Self-Hosted.

To learn more about the different methods of Installing Replicated and options for the easy install script, please refer to the Replicated manual on Installing the application at [https://www.replicated.com/docs/distributing-an-application/installing/](https://www.replicated.com/docs/distributing-an-application/installing/).

## Replicated Configuration
### Replicated Setup
Once Replicated’s services are installed on your server you need to access the management console on your browser. It’s available via SSL on port 8800. So open https://packagist.myintranet.com:8800/ in your browser (replace the domain with your own). You will have to proceed despite the security warning (since your certificate is still missing).

![SSL Warning](/Resources/public/img/docs/self-hosted/01-ssl-warning.png)

Upload your SSL certificate on the next screen. SSL should work correctly from the next page. If your certificate requires intermediate certificates to be recognized by your browser and/or Composer, you can paste them into the certificate file together with your own certificate. Make sure your own certificate comes first, any intermediate certificate next and the root certificate last. If the order is off replicated will not recognize your certificate at all.

On the next screen you can upload the supplied .rli license key file.

![Upload License](/Resources/public/img/docs/self-hosted/03-upload-license.png)

Once validated, you will be asked to set a password for the management console or to protect it with a different authentication mechanism.

### Server Settings
In the management console you will have to configure a few options before you can start the Private Packagist Self-Hosted application.

#### E-mail
Select options for your SMTP server or use the GMail option for a simplified form if want to send email through GMail. This step is required to allow Private Packagist to send transactional email to users.

## Application Startup
Save and apply the settings to start Private Packagist Self-Hosted. Leave the Setup mode enabled.

![Start Application](/Resources/public/img/docs/self-hosted/06-save-start.png)

Once the application has started, click on the open link to access the Private Packagist Self-Hosted Web Interface.

## Configuring an HTTP Proxy
If accessing websites outside of your network, e.g. packagist.org, requires an HTTP proxy then you can
enable and configure this in the Console Settings under the HTTP Proxy section which you can access in
the Replicated management console by clicking on the gear icon in the menu bar.

![HTTP Proxy](/Resources/public/img/docs/self-hosted/07-01-http-proxy.png)

In case the HTTP proxy should not be used to access certain domains or IPs then you can configure such
a NO_PROXY list in the Private Packagist application in the Admin Panel under Global Configuration.

## Authentication Setup
Within Private Packagist Self-Hosted you now need to set up at least one user authentication method. You have the choice between authentication with email addresses and passwords and several OAuth integrations with third party services.
We provide integrations with on-premises versions of GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, or their public services on github.com, bitbucket.org or gitlab.com. Follow the instructions to create the respective required identifiers, tokens and secrets.

* [GitHub (Enterprise) Integration Setup](./github-integration-setup.md)
* [Bitbucket.org Integration Setup](./bitbucket-integration-setup.md)
* [Bitbucket Data Center / Server Integration Setup](./bitbucket-server-integration-setup.md)
* [GitLab Integration Setup](./gitlab-integration-setup.md)
* [Authentication with Email Addresses and Passwords](./authentication-email-addresses-passwords-setup.md).

## Selecting Admins
After setting up at least one authentication mechanism you can login through the top menu. Register an account and pick a username.

![Register Admin](/Resources/public/img/docs/self-hosted/09-register-admin.png)

The first user is granted admin permissions automatically. You can grant admin permissions to more users in the admin panel.

![Add Admin](/Resources/public/img/docs/self-hosted/10-add-admin.png)

## Switching to Production Mode
Head back to the Replicated management console to disable the Setup Mode in Settings.

![Startup Mode](/Resources/public/img/docs/self-hosted/11-startup-mode.png)

Apply the changes and wait while the application restarts.

![Restart Prod](/Resources/public/img/docs/self-hosted/12-restart-prod.png)

That’s it! Private Packagist Self-Hosted is now ready to be used! You’ll find all further information in the web interface.

## Backups
Once the application is running you can create a snapshot in the management console using the “Start Snapshot” button. You can view a list of all snapshots created under “Snapshots” when you click on the gear icon on the menu bar. Further you can configure automatic regular snapshots in the “Console Settings” after clicking on the gear icon. We recommend you configure Snapshots to store files via SFTP or on S3 instead of locally to avoid a very slow snapshot process.

Snapshot are stored in ``/var/lib/replicated/snapshots`` on the Replicated host. This location may not be suitable for keeping large amounts of data. Additionally, by default, it is likely to be on the same physical volume as all other critical data. We highly recommend this location is configured to be on a separate volume with large capacity to ensure data can be recovered in case of a disaster.

If you ever need to restore the application from a snapshot you need to store it on the host’s hard drive before you start the management console. You can then select a snapshot at the setup step that asks for a license key file. See [https://www.replicated.com/docs/kb/supporting-your-customers/restoring-from-a-snapshot/](https://www.replicated.com/docs/kb/supporting-your-customers/restoring-from-a-snapshot/) for screenshots of the process.
