# Adding Integrations
## Private Packagist Cloud

When using [Private Packagist Cloud](https://packagist.com), integrations for
the cloud offerings of GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket are already provided for
every organization by default.

Additional integrations for your organization can only be setup for self-hosted
versions:

- Instructions for setting up an [integration with GitHub Enterprise](./github-enterprise-setup.md).
- Instructions for setting up an [integration with GitLab Self-managed](./gitlab-self-managed-setup.md).
- Instructions for setting up an [integration with BitBucket Data Center / Server](./bitbucket-server-integration.md).
